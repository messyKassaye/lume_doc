      This process could take several minutes and will likely change URLs to library filters. If you
      have menus or links using such URLs, they will probably stop working after the update. You
      will need to update them manually.
    </b>
    <br />
    After selecting this option, you will not be able to revert back to using legacy property
    naming. If you are not facing issues with your template property names, we recommend leaving
    this unchecked.
